Jonathan Bennett
    - Contributed OpenWRT support - see the extras/openwrt/ directory.

Sebastien Jeanquier
    - Assisted with getting fwknop included in BackTrack Linux - the choice
      distro for pentation testers.

Ozmart
    - Suggested the idea for setting an access stanza expiration time.
    - Suggested the abiliy to have certain incoming connections automatically
      NAT'd through to specific internal systems.  The result was the FORCE_NAT
      mode.
    - Assisted with getting fwknop running under the Pentoo Linux distro.

Max Kastanas
    - Contributed both an Android and an iPhone fwknop client port - see the
      top level android/ and iphone/ directories.

Ted Wynnychenko
    - Helped test fwknop PF support on OpenBSD.

Andy Rowland
    - Reported a bug where the same encryption key used for two stanzas in the
      access.conf file would result in access requests that matched the second
      stanza to always be treated as a replay attack.  This has been fixed for
      the fwknop-2.0.1 release.

C Anthony Risinger
    - Caught a bug where the default PCAP_LOOP_SLEEP value was 1/100th of a
      second instead of the intended default of 1/10th of a second.

Franck Joncourt
    - fwknop Debian package maintainer.
    - Contributed a new Debian init script.
    - Contributed a patch to have the perl FKO module link against libfko in
      the local directory (if it exists) so that it doesn't have to have libfko
      completely installed in /usr/lib/.  This allows the test suite to run FKO
      tests without installing libfko.
    - Contributed a patch to remove unnecessary chmod() call when creating
      client rc file and server replay cache file.  The permissions are now set
      appropriately via open(), and at the same time this patch fixes a
      potential race condition since the previous code used fopen() followed by
      chmod().
    - Contributed a patch to allow the fwknop client to be stopped with Ctrl-C
      before sending an SPA packet on the wire.
    - Contributed a patch to ensure that duplicate iptables rules are not
      created even for different SPA packets that arrive at the same time and
      request the same access.
    - Added support for resolving hostnames in various NAT modes (fixes issue
      #43 in github).
    - Added support for saving fwknop client command line arguments via a new
      options --save-rc-stanza.

Jonathan Schulz
    - Submitted patches to change HTTP connection type to 'close' for -R mode
      in the client and fix a bug for recv() calls against returned HTTP data.

Aldan Beaubien
    - Reported an issue with the Morpheus client sending SPA packets with NULL
      IP addresses, and code was added to fwknopd to better validate incoming
      SPA data as a result of this report.

Geoff Carstairs
    - Suggested a way to redirect valid connection requests to a specific
      internal service via NAT, configurable by each stanza in access.conf.
      This allows for better access control for multple users requiring access
      to multiple internal systems, in a manner that is transparent to the
      user.  The result was the FORCE_NAT mode.

Hank Leininger
    - For iptables firewalls, suggested a check for the 'comment' match to
      ensure the local environment will properly support fwknopd operations.
      The result is the new ENABLE_IPT_COMMENT_CHECK functionality.

Fernando Arnaboldi (IOActive)
    - Found important buffer overflow conditions for authenticated SPA clients
      in the fwknopd server (pre-2.0.3).  These findings enabled fixes to be
      developed along with a new fuzzing capability in the test suite.
    - Found a condition in which an overly long IP from malicious authenticated
      clients is not properly validated by the fwknopd server (pre-2.0.3).
    - Found a local buffer overflow in --last processing with a maliciously
      constructed ~/.fwknop.run file.  This has been fixed with proper
      validation of .fwknop.run arguments.
    - Found several conditions in which the server did not properly throw out
      maliciously constructed variables in the access.conf file.  This has been
      fixed along with new fuzzing tests in the test suite.

Vlad Glagolev
    - Submitted a patch to fix ndbm/gdbm usage when --disable-file-cache is
      used for the autoconf configure script.  This functionality was broken in
      be4193d734850fe60f14a26b547525ea0b9ce1e9 through improper handling of
      #define macros from --disable-file-cache.
    - Submitted a patch to fix command exec mode under SPA message type
      validity test.  Support for command exec mode was also added to the test
      suite.
    - Submitted an OpenBSD port for fwknop-2.0.3, and this has been checked in
      under extras/openbsd/.

Sean Greven
    - Created a port of fwknop for FreeBSD:
      http://portsmon.freebsd.org/portoverview.py?category=security&portname=fwknop

Michael T. Dean
    - Reported the Rijndael key truncation issue for user-supplied keys
      (passphrases) greater than 16 bytes long.

George Herlin
    - Proposed a verification approach to test suite operations, and the result
      was implemented in a61939c005e2b09d6800e2171f607c9d1948f022.  This makes
      test suite operate equivalently regardless of whether valgrind is used or
      whether fwknop is being tested on an embedded system with very limited
      resources.
